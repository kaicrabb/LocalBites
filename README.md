# LocalBites
### Summary of Project Plans
This is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) and website where users can view local restaurants near them, as well as give these local restaurants reviews. The end goal of the app is to show the user a map which displays their location (when permission is given) to show local restaurants near them, as well as a page listing the local restaurants (useful if the user denies location permission or prefers a list). From here they can filter restaurants on favorites, price point, type of food, rating, etc. The user will be able to leave reviews on any of the restaurants they’ve been to. The user will also be able to scroll through videos of restaurants near them. The user will have a profile page, which will display reviews written by the user, saved restaurants, and any personal information tied to a user account.
